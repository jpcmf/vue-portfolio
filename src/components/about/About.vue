          <p>I am a UI Designer and Front-end Developer from Brazil based in Curitiba. I like working as freelancer, solving problems with Design and making great ideas happen. I love sharing the knowledge that I have gained from my experience with other people. When I am not developing websites I like to produce electronic music and play some records. You can find me on Twitter (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/jpcmf80" target="_blank">@jpcmf80</a>) and, if you're interested in my professional experience, please have a look at my links or drop me a message.</p>
